# Tableau---Visualizations

Using Tableau Public, I was able to create a visual breakdown of various AirBnB statistics.

I analyzed the average price per bedroom, and noticed a rising trend. Price per zip code was also taken into consideration, using both an interactive map and a color-coded chart. Other factors considered included the distributino of listings by number of bedrooms, as well as the revenue generated over a year.
